All code for UT Tyler IEEE R5 Robotics Senior Design Team

Each top directory folder is a different ATmel Studio 7 project created using the Arduino/Visual Micro plug-in

In order to build and upload the project you must have a locally installed Arduino IDE (v1.8.1+), Atmel Studio 7 and two external Arduino libraries, FastLED and Adafruit NeoPixel

Alternatively, Atmel Studio 7 is not required to open the .ino files in the Arduino IDE (v1.8.1+)
